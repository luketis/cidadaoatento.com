Collaborative troubleshooter for  cities!

Cidad√£o Atento is my TCC (something like completion of course work), it was developed in 2012 when I was 17 years old. We got a stand to show our work at Tecnofeira hosted by Cotemig (tech school). We did not won any prize but it was a good experience for our carrer.

The project was made on top of Google Maps and CodeIgniter, some libraries as Bootstrap has been used too.
